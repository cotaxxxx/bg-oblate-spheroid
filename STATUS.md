## Global status

`NOT_BINDING / DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY`

This repository currently contains no certified theorem, certified numerical
value, approved production kernel, or Actions-produced clean-room certificate.

## Analytically derived kernel

For the oblate spheroid

```text
x^2 + y^2 + z^2/lambda^2 = 1,   0 < lambda < 1,
```

write an axial base point as `p = (0, 0, lambda*t)` and set

```text
q = 1 - mu^2 + lambda^2*(mu - t)^2
w^2 = lambda^2*(1 - mu^2) + mu^2
gamma = lambda*(1 - t*mu)/(w*sqrt(q))
h(c) = acos(c)^2
```

Then

```text
E_lambda(t) = (1/2) integral[-1,1] (1 - t*mu)*h(gamma) dmu
g_axis_ob(t,lambda) = partial_t E_lambda(t)
b_ob(lambda) = g_axis_ob(1,lambda)
```

The substitution `mu = 1 - s^2` regularizes the transformed endpoint
density and supports a one-sided `C^1` extension to `t = 1`. This analytic
statement still requires a formal manuscript proof and independent audit.

## Candidate numerical evidence — not certified

The following values are candidate evidence, not certified enclosures:

```text
lambda_entry_ob = 0.6435457703666799690435  [HIGH_PRECISION; mpmath dps=40; tanh-sinh]
lambda_axis_ob  = 0.4079588603009463642491058701855256993  [HIGH_PRECISION; two-source agreement]
b_ob_prime      = +1.10246                  [HIGH_PRECISION; two-source agreement]
gt_boundary_ob  = -1.45623019               [HIGH_PRECISION; mpmath dps=50; one-sided differences]
entry_slope_ob  = 0.757064                  [HIGH_PRECISION; ratio b_ob_prime/(-gt_boundary_ob)]
b_ob(1)         = pi^2/32                   [EXACT]
```

The original values were supplied through chat and remain candidate evidence
under the two-layer certification rule. `lambda_axis_ob` now has two direct
computational sources: the original `mpmath` evaluation (`dps=40`,
tanh-sinh) and a native axial-equation calculation of
`partial_t g_axis_ob(0,lambda)=0` using Python `Decimal`, split standalone
tanh-sinh quadrature, centered slopes, and Richardson extrapolation at 50 and
80 decimal digits. The two native precision settings agree through the stable
prefix printed above, and the result agrees with the original recorded value
through all 20 of its decimal places. `lambda_entry_ob` also has an
independent Decimal/tanh-sinh reproduction of the endpoint equation.

The `b_ob_prime` candidate now has a second numerical source: the binary64
Simpson fold diagnostic reproduces local difference ratios approximately
`1.10247` to `1.10250` across the boundary sign change, consistent with
the prior high-precision value `1.10246`. The endpoint derivative candidate
uses the independently audited one-sided sequence
`-1.45550032, -1.45622003, -1.45623006, -1.45623019, -1.45623019` for
steps `1e-4, 1e-6, 1e-8, 1e-10, 1e-12`. None of these agreements promotes
a value to `CERTIFIED_ENCLOSURE`.

Expected signs:

```text
b_ob(0.60) < 0
b_ob(0.70) > 0
b_ob(1) = pi^2/32 > 0
```

Measured diagnostic values for the first two signs were approximately
`-0.04917` and `+0.06016`. Their derivation class remains diagnostic. Failure
to reproduce the signs requires investigation; agreement does not constitute
certification.

## Full-window axial census

An independent binary64 composite-Simpson scan sampled the full positive axial
branch window at `lambda=0.408` and at 0.01 increments from `0.410` through
`0.640`, followed by the existing fine endpoint refinement.

At all 25 full-window samples:

- exactly one sign-changing root was observed on `0<t<1`;
- the root increased monotonically from `t=0.019825...` to `t=0.997268...`;
- `partial_t g_axis_ob` at the root was negative;
- no additional positive-axis root or interior-fold signature was observed.

The endpoint refinement continues this branch to `t=1` at
`lambda_entry_ob`. GitHub Actions run #85 succeeded. The machine-readable
record is
[diagnostics/oblate_fold_scan_result.json](diagnostics/oblate_fold_scan_result.json).

This remains `DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY / NOT_BINDING`. Finite sampling cannot exclude
an arbitrarily narrow root pair, prove negativity between nodes, or exclude
off-axis meridian stationary points. A binding conclusion requires interval
coverage of the full branch region and its complement.

## Precision-robustness correction

A precision-dependent endpoint failure was reproduced in the prototype
`b_ob` evaluator. The former `64*mp.eps` post-division slack admitted or
rejected a rounded value of `gamma` non-monotonically as the requested
precision changed. Failures were observed at dps 30, 35, 60, and 80.

The regression test was committed before the implementation correction. The
endpoint geometry now evaluates the exact factorization

```text
1 - gamma^2
  = (2 - s^2)*(1 - (1 - lambda^2)*s^2)^2/(w^2*qhat).
```

This exposes the endpoint factor `2-s^2` and avoids forming a quotient that
can round above one. A tanh-sinh node whose rounded `s^2` exceeds 2 only by
at most `sqrt(eps)` is projected to the exact endpoint; a larger excursion
fails closed.

Correction checkpoint:

```text
branch head = 5cc212d47145704d39cb486df28eefc2e3938d79
workflow run = #43, success
status       = PROTOTYPE / NOT_AUDITED
```

The project owner independently checked the factorization and reran the
corrected evaluator at ten precision settings from dps 20 through 120. All
previously failing settings completed, and the observed error decreased from
approximately `1e-22` to `1e-122` with increasing precision. Values at
`lambda=0.408` and the reported root agreed across dps 30, 50, and 80.
This verifies the robustness correction but does not promote the evaluator or
any numerical value to `AUDITED_SOURCE`, `CERTIFIED_ENCLOSURE`, or
`CERTIFIED`.

The earlier split-versus-unsplit quadrature comparison is now optional
diagnostic work rather than a blocking obligation, because the unsplit
quadrature displays precision-proportional convergence over the tested range.

A second occurrence of the same robustness defect was subsequently found in
the interior `g_axis_ob` path for `t<1`. The case
`g_axis_ob(0.99,0.63)` reproduced the former dps-dependent failure pattern.
The general identity

```text
1 - gamma^2
  = (1 - mu^2)*((1 - lambda^2)*mu + lambda^2*t)^2/(w^2*q)
```

now replaces the direct quotient on that path. It reduces exactly to the
endpoint factorization when `t=1`. A dps 30, 50, and 80 regression was
committed before the implementation change. GitHub Actions run #61 succeeded,
and the previously recorded center-axis nondegeneracy sequence was unchanged
at all printed digits. The correction checkpoint is
`c9fb76ebdb94fd16bdbe9414107693952874cc9f`. Evidence status remains
`PROTOTYPE / NOT_AUDITED`.

## Candidate center-axis nondegeneracy

A 50-dps centered-difference and Richardson diagnostic at
`lambda_axis_ob` produced

```text
A_ob(lambda_axis_ob)       = -5.55e-25
A_ob_prime(lambda_axis_ob) = +2.491132481221525520635103855...
C_ob                       = -0.261396885193674917352806250...
-A_ob_prime/C_ob           = +9.530077144476257310077726938...
```

Here `A_ob(lambda)=partial_t g_axis_ob(0,lambda)` and `C_ob` is the
coefficient of `t^3` in the odd expansion of `g_axis_ob` at the center.
The raw sequences converge with stable positive sign for `A_ob_prime` and
stable negative sign for `C_ob`. The candidate normal form is therefore

```text
t^2 approximately 9.5300771445*(lambda-lambda_axis_ob),
```

so the candidate noncentral axial branch lies on the
`lambda > lambda_axis_ob` side, consistent with absorption into the center as
lambda decreases. The full diagnostic record is
[diagnostics/oblate_axis_nondegeneracy_result.json](diagnostics/oblate_axis_nondegeneracy_result.json).

Evidence status remains `DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY / NOT_BINDING`; derivation class is
`HIGH_PRECISION`. GitHub Actions run #53 succeeded. These calculations do not
prove nondegeneracy or supply certified coefficient enclosures.

## Candidate transverse index on the axial branch

For a transverse displacement `p=(r,0,lambda*t)`, the second derivative
`Q_perp_ob=E_rr(0,t,lambda)` was reduced analytically to a one-dimensional
azimuthally averaged integral and evaluated at seven positive-axis branch
points.

```text
lambda    t                     z=lambda*t            Q_perp_ob
0.42      0.3299485239648909    0.1385783800652542    +1.5188410161701126
0.45      0.5793708519677305    0.2607168833854787    +1.4279175760127804
0.50      0.7802783958430172    0.3901391979215086    +1.2639635299552409
0.55      0.8909899971394450    0.4900444984266947    +1.0968377348233276
0.60      0.9599010020396870    0.5759406012238122    +0.9346164228385508
0.63      0.9890775444970755    0.6231188530331576    +0.8414580737026062
0.6435    0.9999653387083598    0.6434776954588295    +0.8007594212804716
0.64354   0.9999956312719532    0.6435371885487528    +0.8006400688400387
0.643545  0.9999994167777902    0.6435446246702630    +0.8006251504169961
0.6435457 0.9999999467277163    0.6435456657168509    +0.8006230618498125
```

At the center-axis threshold, the direct center evaluation gives

```text
Q_perp_ob(0,lambda_axis_ob) = +1.552401991182093646603194122...
```

This is close to the first branch sample `+1.518841...` at `lambda=0.42`
and supports continuous connection of the branch transverse eigenvalue to the
positive center transverse eigenvalue. Thus the candidate center degeneracy is
purely axial: the axial eigenvalue vanishes while the transverse double
eigenvalue remains positive.

At the boundary-entry end, the sequence
`lambda=0.6435, 0.64354, 0.643545, 0.6435457` gives

```text
Q_perp_ob = 0.8007594, 0.8006401, 0.8006252, 0.8006231.
```

The values approach a positive finite limit rather than zero. This supports a
purely axial boundary entry: no simultaneous transverse degeneracy is observed.

All sampled transverse eigenvalues are positive and remain separated from
zero. Together with the negative axial second variation, this supports Morse
index 1 for the sampled noncentral stationary points. The machine-readable
record is
[diagnostics/oblate_transverse_index_result.json](diagnostics/oblate_transverse_index_result.json).

Evidence status is `DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY / NOT_BINDING`; derivation class is
`HIGH_PRECISION`. GitHub Actions runs #67, #73, and #79 succeeded. Finite sampling does not
prove positivity on the entire branch and does not exclude additional
stationary points.

## Endpoint analytic reduction and exact controls

The boundary functional is now defined explicitly as the one-sided limit
`B_ob(lambda)=lim[t->1-] partial_t E_lambda(t)`. The direct endpoint integral,
including cone weight and Jacobian, is derived in
[analysis/endpoint_kernel_lemma.md](analysis/endpoint_kernel_lemma.md).

The reduction uses two analytic charts split at `s=1`. This is necessary
because `u=1-gamma^2` has an internal double zero at
`s^2=1/(1-lambda^2)` throughout the present oblate window. The note fixes the
positive branch of `gamma`, records uniform denominator and chart bounds,
includes the full endpoint-order checks, and justifies differentiation under
the integral on compact rational lambda intervals. It also distinguishes the
fixed-ball static normalization from any metric or gradient-flow choice.

Exact rational controls were added before an interval implementation. They
check the complement identity, endpoint values, internal double zero, seam
targets, and the `A*gamma_t` factorization without calling an integrator or
the prototype evaluator. GitHub Actions run #95 succeeded, with these controls
executed before all implementation-calling checks.

The endpoint-local source checkpoint
`3406baad993701758a74ca9b42976412ca27b781` is `AUDITED_SOURCE`.
Its seven load-bearing controls are recorded as six exact families plus one
implementation-calling quadrature family. The audit receipt and remaining
producer-stage limitations are fixed in [AUDIT_PIN.md](AUDIT_PIN.md).

Evidence remains `DIAGNOSTIC_ONLY / NOT_BINDING`. No interval enclosure or
uniqueness claim has been produced; `AUDITED_SOURCE` applies only to the
pinned source bytes and is not a numerical certification.

## Open obligations

- intervalize the audited endpoint-regular axial source;
- share the transformed `s**3` weight between production density and the
  implementation-calling bookkeeping control;
- make the future Arb checker rerun the bookkeeping control on producer data
  instead of trusting its `PASS` label;
- certify existence, uniqueness, and transversality of `lambda_entry_ob`;
- certify `b_ob_prime > 0` and `gt_boundary_ob < 0`;
- certify the center-axis degeneracy and nondegenerate pitchfork coefficients;
- exclude interior folds and additional meridian stationary points globally;
- keep the `lambda -> 0` uniform tail outside the present finite-window claim.

## Arb endpoint-local implementation candidate

An Arb producer and a source-independent checker are now implemented on top
of the pinned audited analytic source. The producer emits 1024-panel-per-unit
cell records at 160-bit precision. The checker ignores producer PASS labels
and final sums and independently reconstructs series tails, kernel ranges,
cell integrals, totals, and the three binding signs.

The first end-to-end candidate run gave:

~~~text
B_ob(5/8)              subset [-0.02548935, -0.01580721]
B_ob(33/50)            subset [ 0.01336182,  0.02259274]
B_ob_prime([5/8,33/50]) subset [ 0.41835218,  1.88100252]
~~~

Thus the machine path presently separates all three required quantities from
zero and returns the conditional conclusion that B_ob has exactly one zero
in [5/8,33/50]. The record also rechecks transformed quadrature bookkeeping
on the producer partition, while the mpmath implementation-calling control
shares its s**3 weight with the production energy density.

Classification remains `NOT_BINDING / PROTOTYPE` for this new implementation
unit. The enclosures must not be called CERTIFIED until the producer/checker
source is independently audited, pinned, and rerun through the clean-room
receipt chain.

The receipt conclusion is explicitly conditional on the endpoint analytic
lemma and on the one-sided `t -> 1` limit/interchange needed to identify the
zero with the boundary passage of the interior census branch. That latter
identification remains an analytic obligation.
